<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I obtained my MPhil degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), where I was advised by Prof. [Sai-Kit Yeung](https://saikit.org/). Prior to that, I earned my B.S. in Computer Science (Advanced Program) with highest distinction (GPA: 3.93/4.0) from the University of Science, VNU - HCM, under the guidance of Prof. [Minh-Triet Tran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=vi&user=lt2ATkkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My research focuses on multimodal understanding, building upon a foundation in computer vision (detection & segmentation). I explored these areas during my MPhil at HKUST and now apply them to multimodal/multitask generation model at Huawei HKRC as AI Research Engineer, contributing to the [MindONE](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone) project.
My core interests include:
- Vision-language foundation model for navigation, interaction and action: Creating agents that can understand natural language instructions to navigate, interact and act with real-world or virtual environments.
- Multimodal event reasoning: Developing models that precisely locate and describe complex events in long-form videos using visual and auditory cues.

[**Project**](https://vatex.hkustvgd.com/) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- VATEX is a novel method for referring image segmentation that leverages vision-aware text features to improve text understanding. By decomposing language cues into object and context understanding, the model can better localize objects and interpret complex sentences, leading to significant performance gains.
